Thus far we have compared a variable to a box. Much like a box can store something inside it — like a shoe — a variable can store a value inside it, like the number 7.

We also know that there can be several types of boxes — a shoe box, a box with a ring, a box of chocolates. Similarly a variable can be of several types — an integer, some text.

The following video will build on this idea of the different types of variables.
