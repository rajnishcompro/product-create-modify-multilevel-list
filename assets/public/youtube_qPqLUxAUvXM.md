## Feedback
- If the box is empty, say “It seems you haven’t entered an answer. If you do not know the answer, feel free to say so.
- If the answer contains  “I don’t know”, “no idea”, “no clue” , “bug”, “error”- “That’s ok. We are trying to create a custom course for you, so it is good for us to know what you know.”
- If the answer contains “You saved a lot this month” - “Hmm..The account balance was 2000. It seems the program says this when the account balance is >= 3000.
- If the answer contains “You could save a little more a lot this month” - “Perfect. You were able to read the program correctly. Now we know that you know how if statements work.
- If the user enters gibberish, detect it using this code, and say - “That seems like it is not English. You want to try again?” 
- If the answer was anything else - “We couldn’t quite understand what you said. Try again.”
