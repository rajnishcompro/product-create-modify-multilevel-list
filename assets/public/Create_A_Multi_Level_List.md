We admit, programming can be tough. Think of a programmer in popular culture and you see images of math or some acronyms that barely make sense. We know this because we’ve experienced this scenario. Although, we also have had some great teachers who learning easy.

In this course, we will follow the path of excellent teachers. We will teach important programming ideas, but will make sure the learning curve is never too difficult.

While learning about programming, we will build several projects like an alarm clock, plagiarism detection software, a video game, draw shapes and much more.

We will use a programming language called Python to write our code. Python is a powerful coding language used by organizations like Google, Yahoo, NASA and others. 

Now you will find that this course is adaptive; the simplest way to describe what that means is that it is not one size fits all. As you proceed through the course, we will learn more about you — your learning preferences and programming proficiencies, and based on that this course will change to create a unique learning path for you.

Speaking of getting to know you, answer the following 3 questions to help us create a custom learning experience for you.
