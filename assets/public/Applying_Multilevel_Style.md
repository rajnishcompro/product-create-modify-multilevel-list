Let’s begin with a simple question. It’s ok if you do not know the answer to this. We will use this quiz to create a course that best fits your learning needs.

What’s the output of the following code?

## Options
1. I don’t know
2. The height is 300
3. No output; there is an error in the code.
4. [Correct] The height is 30000

## Feedback
1. That’s ok. We are trying to create a custom course for you, so it is good for us to know what you know.
2. Check line 4. There is a multiplication operation happening there
3. Hmm. We tried this code and there was no error in it.
4. That’s correct. With this you have demonstrated that you know how variables, comments and print statements work in Python. This is great for us to know
