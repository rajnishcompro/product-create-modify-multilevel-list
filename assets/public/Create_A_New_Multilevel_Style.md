Will this code ever end?

![](images/00/Q3_Never_Ending_Loop.png)

## Feedback
1. I don’t know
2. [Correct] No, this code will not stop running, until we force quit the program. 
3. Yes, this code will stop after running 1000 times
4. There is an error in this code

## Rules (R3)
- R3a - If the user responds with A, give them the following remedial material T2, V6.
- R3b - If the user responds with B, “This is correct. Now we know that you know how while loops work.”  Skip to the next quiz question, i.e. Q4. 
- R3c - If the user responds with C: Hmm. Have a look at line 2 again, do you think the code suggests that the program end after the while loop has executed a 1000 times.
- R3d - If the user responds with D: That’s interesting. We were able to run this code without any errors.
- R3e - If the learner makes two consecutive mistakes, give them remedial material for loops by skipping to T2, V6.
