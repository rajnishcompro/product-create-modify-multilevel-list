The following video will introduce you to the idea of variables. The instructor compares a variable to a box in which you can store a value. While watching the video, you should type in the code in the space below to test out the new ideas you are learning.

{video-youtube}{Intro to Variables}{All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y), or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names must begin with a letter. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial). Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables). Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chiCqftYf4o
