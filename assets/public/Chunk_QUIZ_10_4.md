I have been teaching students how to program for several years now, and the one thing I notice constantly is that getting your computer ready to start to code is harder than it needs to be. Donâ€™t worry. We will do this together.

Installing Python will allow us to write computer programs. Now in addition to the programming language, we will need a space to write the programs. Almost like a notepad is needed to write letters. That space for Python is called IDLE. Luckily, the process of installing Python also installs IDLE on the computer. 

Now based on your computer type (Mac or Windows) we will present to you custom instructions on how to install Python next. This should take 10-15 minutes.
