(Text box)


Feedback
- If the textbox is empty, say “It seems you haven’t entered an answer. If you do not know the answer, feel free to say so.
- If the answer contains  “I don’t know”, “no idea”, “no clue” , “bug”, “error”- “That’s ok. We are trying to create a custom course for you, so it is good for us to know what you know.”
- If the answer contains 5  or 3  or five or three say “Hmm.. There are two loops in this code. Outer loop that runs 5 times; and for each time the outer loop runs, the inner loop runs 3 times. So we ask you again, how many times will the print statement run.
- If the answer contains 15 or fifteen say - “Perfect. You were able to evaluate the program correctly. Now we know that you know how nested for loops work.
- If the user enters gibberish, detect it, and say - “That seems like it is not English. You want to try again?” 
- If the answer was anything else - “We couldn’t quite understand what you said. Try again.”
